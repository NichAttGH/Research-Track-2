# Assignment Research Track2

The assignment is divided in three parts:.
* Creating a full documentation using Sphinx or Doxygen for the [RT1 II assignment code](https://github.com/NichAttGH/NichAtt_RT1_II_A.git).



## First Task

In this part of the work, after installing Sphinx and ReadTheDocs theme, I just commented the codes of the RT1_II_A, and the page with all the documentation was created.  
All the new documentation can be found in [this link](https://nichattgh.github.io/NichAtt_RT2_I_A/).
