# Research Track 2

The assignment is divided in three parts:
* Creating a full documentation using Sphinx or Doxygen for the [RT1 II assignment code](https://github.com/NichAttGH/Research-Track-1).
* Write a Jupyter file that represents these goals:
  - Some buttons for handling the motion of the robot in the environment;
  - A plot with the robotâ€™s position and targetsâ€™ positions in the environment;
  - A text box with the distance of the closest obstacle (or the overall plot of the laserscanner);
  - A plot for the number of reached/not-reached targets
* Write a report, about the [RT1 I assignment code](https://github.com/NichAttGH/NichAtt_RT1_I_A.git), composed of:
  - Hypotheses made;
  - Description and motivation of the experimental setup;
  - Results;
  - Discussion of the results with statistical analysis;
  - Conclusion

## First Task

In this part of the work, after installing Sphinx and ReadTheDocs theme, I just commented the codes of the RT1_II_A, and the page with all the documentation was created.  
All the new documentation can be found in [this link](https://nichattgh.github.io/NichAtt_RT2_I_A/).

## Second Task

After installing Jupyter Notebook, remember that we reference to the [IIÂ° assignment of Research Track 1](https://github.com/NichAttGH/NichAtt_RT1_II_A.git)

### Initialization
We need to load jupyter cells so at the beginning we import everything we need and initialize the data

```
# import ros and jupyter stuff
import rospy
import actionlib
import actionlib.msg
import sys, select
import assignment_2_2022.msg
from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry
from assignment_2_2022.msg import custom_msg
from std_srvs.srv import *
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist, Pose, Point

import ipywidgets as widgets
import jupyros as jr
import time
from assignment_2_2022.srv import service_goals, service_goalsRequest
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sensor_msgs.msg import LaserScan
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
import math
from IPython.display import display
%matplotlib widget

global count_goals_reached
global count_goals_canceled

# Initialization the data
count_goals_reached = 0
count_goals_canceled = 0
categories = ['Goals Reached', 'Goals Canceled']
```

Now we have the callback function *publish_msg* of the subscriber to create a custom message and to publish it on the topic */odom* with the difference that there is a little part that allow us to see every 100ms the position of the robot

```
def publish_msg(message):
   
    global publisher
    global last_time_published_odom
        
    # Get the position and velocity
    pos_x = round(message.pose.pose.position.x, 1)
    pos_y = round(message.pose.pose.position.y, 1)
    vel_x = message.twist.twist.linear.x
    vel_y = message.twist.twist.linear.y

    # Creation of the custom message
    custom_message = custom_msg()
    
    custom_message.actual_x = pos_x
    custom_message.actual_y = pos_y
    custom_message.actual_vel_x = vel_x
    custom_message.actual_vel_y = vel_y
    
    # Publishing the custom message
    publisher.publish(custom_message)
    
    # This part is necessary to see costantly the robot position every 100ms
    current_time = time.time() * 1000
    if current_time - last_time_published_odom > 100:
        print("\rRobot position: x={}, y={}".format(pos_x, pos_y), end='')
        last_time_published_odom = current_time
```

Then we have 2 functions: one for the button to send the goal and another one to cancel the goal

```
def on_send_goal_button_clicked(b):
    # Call 'action_cliient' function
    action_client()
    
def action_client():
    global goal

    # Creation of the goal for the robot
    goal = assignment_2_2022.msg.PlanningGoal()
    goal.target_pose.pose.position.x = w_coordinate_x.value
    goal.target_pose.pose.position.y = w_coordinate_y.value

    # Send goal to the server
    act_client.send_goal(goal)

def on_cancel_goal_button_clicked(b):
    global goal
    
    # Cancel the goal
    act_client.cancel_goal()
    
    goal = None
```

Obviously, we define buttons

```
# Widgets to give the goal coordinates
w_coordinate_x = widgets.FloatText(description='Coordinate X:', step = 0.1)
w_coordinate_y = widgets.FloatText(description='Coordinate Y:', step = 0.1)

# Button to send the goal
send_goal_button = widgets.Button(
description='Send goal to the robot',
layout = widgets.Layout(width = 'auto'))

send_goal_button.on_click(on_send_goal_button_clicked)

# Button to cancel the goal
cancel_goal_button = widgets.Button(
description='Cancel goal sent to the robot',
layout = widgets.Layout(width = 'auto'))

cancel_goal_button.on_click(on_cancel_goal_button_clicked)
```

If we want to see the distance from the closest obstacle, we create a FloatText and declare a callback to show the distance from the closest obstacle

```
# Create a widget to show the distance between the robot and the closest obstacle
dist_closest_ob = widgets.FloatText(description = "Distance from the closest obstacle", disabled = True)

# Function to compute the distance between the robot and the closest obstacle
def callback_closest_obstacle(scan):
    min = 50
    for x in scan.ranges: 
        if x > 0.1 and x < min:
            min = x
    dist_closest_ob.value = min 
    
display(dist_closest_ob)
```

Now we have a function that we need to take values of counters of goals reached and canceled from the service Nobe_B and these values will be used into the plot

```
def call_Node_B():
    # Creation of the service client to send the request for goals reached and canceled
    rospy.wait_for_service('Node_B')
    Node_B_serviceProxy = rospy.ServiceProxy('Node_B', service_goals)
    response = Node_B_serviceProxy(service_goalsRequest())
    return response
```

Furthermore we have this callback to assign the values of the counter to other 2 variables used to plot the bar chart

```
def goals_callback(message):
    global count_goals_reached, count_goals_canceled
    # Get the number of goals reached and canceled
    response = call_Node_B()
    count_goals_reached = response.count_reached_goals
    count_goals_canceled = response.count_canceled_goals
```

At this point, we have a class that plots the robot position with the goal position and the path of the robot

```
# Animation class used to plot the robot's position and goal's position
class PositionVisualizer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Init function
        self.fig, self.ax = plt.subplots()
        # Settings for robot's position plot
        self.ln, = plt.plot([], [], 'bo', label = 'Robot position')
        # Settings for target's position plot
        self.goal_ln, = plt.plot([], [], 'r*', markersize = 10, label = 'Goal position')
        # Robot's position data arrays
        self.x_data, self.y_data = [], []
    
    def plot_init(self):
        # Set axis limits
        self.ax.set_xlim(10, -10)
        self.ax.set_ylim(10, -10)
        # Set the grid
        self.ax.grid(True, color = 'lightgrey')
        # Set the title
        self.ax.set_title('Robot position to the goal position')
        # Set the legend
        self.ax.legend(loc = 'upper right')
        
        return self.ln, self.goal_ln
    
    def odom_callback(self, message):
        # Callback function to update the data arrays
        self.x_data.append(message.pose.pose.position.x)
        self.y_data.append(message.pose.pose.position.y)
    
    def update_plot(self, frame):
        # Update the robot position plot
        self.ln.set_data(self.x_data, self.y_data)

        # With this, we can delete the goal marker into the plot
        if goal is not None:
            self.goal_ln.set_data(goal.target_pose.pose.position.x, goal.target_pose.pose.position.y)
        else:
            self.goal_ln.set_data([], [])
        return self.ln, self.goal_ln
```

The last part is to inizialize the node and other entities like publisher, action client etc..

```
# Creation of the Interface
rospy.init_node('Jupyter')

# Creation of the publisher
publisher = rospy.Publisher('/position_and_velocity', custom_msg, queue_size = 1)

# Creation of the subscriber for results
sub_result = rospy.Subscriber('/reaching_goal/result', assignment_2_2022.msg.PlanningActionResult, goals_callback)
    
# Creation of the action client
act_client = actionlib.SimpleActionClient('/reaching_goal', assignment_2_2022.msg.PlanningAction)

# Waiting the server
act_client.wait_for_server()
    
# Initialization
goal = None
```

### How to run the file
To see the _robot position_, run this cell

```
last_time_published_odom = 0
jr.subscribe('/odom', Odometry, publish_msg)
```

To see the _distance from the closest obstacle_, run this cell

```
jr.subscribe('/scan', LaserScan, callback_closest_obstacle)
```

To see the _interface_, run this cell

```
display(widgets.HBox([w_coordinate_x, w_coordinate_y]))
display(widgets.HBox([send_goal_button, cancel_goal_button]))
```

To see the plot of the _robot position and goal position_, run this cell

```
# Create the visualizer object
position_visualizer = PositionVisualizer()
    
# Subscriber for the odom topic
sub = rospy.Subscriber('/odom', Odometry, position_visualizer.odom_callback)

# Plot
position_animation = FuncAnimation(
    position_visualizer.fig,
    position_visualizer.update_plot,
    init_func = position_visualizer.plot_init,
    cache_frame_data = False)
plt.show(block = True)
```

To see the plot of the _goals reached and canceled_, run this cell where we initialize the bar chart and with _update chart_ function we update the bar chart every time we click on the update button

```
# Create the initial bar chart
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
bar_chart = ax.bar(categories, [count_goals_reached, count_goals_canceled])
ax.set_ylabel('Values')
ax.set_xlabel('Goals')
ax.set_title('Goals reached and canceled')
ax.set_ylim([0, 10])

# Define the update function
def update_chart(b):
    # Update the bar chart with new values
    bar_chart[0].set_height(count_goals_reached)
    bar_chart[1].set_height(count_goals_canceled)
    fig.canvas.draw()

# Create the update button
update_button = widgets.Button(description='Update Chart')
update_button.on_click(update_chart)

# Display the button
display(update_button)

# Show the chart
plt.show()
```

## Third Task
The last one consists of performing a statistical analysis on the first assignment of Research Track 1, considering two different implementations (mine and a
solution of one of my colleagues) and testing which one performs better, when silver and golden tokens are randomly placed in the environment.

Specifically, write a report composed of:
* Hypotheses made (null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis)
* Description and motivation of the experimental setup (types of experiments, number of repetitions)
* Results
* Discussion of the results with statistical analysis
* Conclusion (is the hypothesis proven?)
